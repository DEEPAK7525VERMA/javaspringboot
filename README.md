# Spring Boot Learning Playground

This repository is where I practice and experiment with **Java + Spring Boot** while learning.

My goal is to understand core Spring concepts by building small features, fixing bugs, and writing simple APIs — step by step.

---

## ✨ What I have practiced so far

- Creating REST APIs with `@RestController`
- Handling requests using `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`
- Connecting Spring Boot with a database (H2 / MySQL)
- Basic CRUD operations using Spring Data JPA
- Exception handling and `ResponseEntity`
- Validation using `@Valid`
